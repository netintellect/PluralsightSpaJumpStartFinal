Data bars are very easy to be placed in a grid view and bound to corresponding view model's properties. The RadStackedDataBar is bound to a list of tuples(int, string). The int value is used to define the length of the bar and the string property is used for the tooltip that is shown. The length of each bar in the stacked data bar represents the corresponding value in relevance to the set minimum and maximum.
