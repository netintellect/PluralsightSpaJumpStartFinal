This example demonstrates the use of out of range templates. Both RadStackedDataBar and RadDataBar allow you to set a template which is visible only when the vlaue is less than the minimum (underflow) ro greater than the maximum (overflow). Using these templates out of range values can be indicated accordingly. This can be very helpful if most of the incoming values are small numbers and there are just a few large values.
