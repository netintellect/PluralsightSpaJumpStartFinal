Telerik NumericUpDown control is fully configurable in terms of navigation. You can entirely control the minimum and maximum values, the step, with which the value will be changed, the delay of that change, the repeat interval, etc. You can use the configuration options on the right to configure the NumericUpDown control as per your requirements. The name of the properties are self-explanatory.
