This example demonstrates how different colorizers can be used for different columns (such as the Smart Rank column), and how a colorizer can be shared between two or more columns (like the two Tuition columns). Even though the Smart Rank ranges from 0 to 50, and the tuition columns range from 30,000 to 50,000, they are colored in a similar manner. This is a result of the two different colorizers being in a relative mode and have the same colors for min and max values.
