RadDataForm provides a way to display and edit arbitrary business objects in a form layout. It provides a basic UI for navigation trough a collection of business objects as well. The built in editors are auto generated by default, so that a fully operational CRUD support may be achieved with a single line of code - just binding to the business object.
