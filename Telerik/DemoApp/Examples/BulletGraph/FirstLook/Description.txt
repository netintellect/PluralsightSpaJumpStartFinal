RadBulletGraph and RadSparkLine are another major addition to the <strong>Telerik.Windows.Controls.DataVisualization</strong> set of components. Their strength to visualize a rich display of data in a small space is essential for quick and easy understanding and comparison of key point indicators in any dashboard or report. The Bullet graph compares a featured measure to one or more related measures (for example, a target or the same measure at some point in the past, such as a year ago) and relates the featured measure to defined quantitative ranges that declare its qualitative state (for example, good, satisfactory, and poor).
