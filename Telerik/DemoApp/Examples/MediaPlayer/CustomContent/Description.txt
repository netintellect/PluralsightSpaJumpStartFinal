Telerik MediaPlayer allows you to easily set custom content for the MediaPlayer's playlist items(MediaItem) and MediaItem's Chapters. In this example you should choose an item from the playlist and click on it to play it. While the media item is being played you can go back and forth using the chapters. The chapters bar will appear upon hovering over the sliding area.
