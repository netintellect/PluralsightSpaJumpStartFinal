RadTileList displays tiles in a mosaic manner. 
It allows you to represent a small amount of data in the form of tiles that the end-user is able to smoothly scroll left or right with a gesture, just like in Windows 8.
The tiles can be reordered by drag and drop. 
RadTileList is the right choice if you need to achieve fast and easy the Modern Style UI for your XAML applications, similar to the Start Menu screen of Windows 8.
