This example shows how to databind RadChart to different datasources. You can use the combobox in the right to change the datasource for the chart.<br/>RadChart has a collection of SeriesMapping objects. Each SeriesMapping in turn has a collection of ItemMapping objects. These objects define the DataPoint member which will be populated when databinding and the field which will provide the data for this member. You can see this in details in SetDataMappings method. When no SeriesMappings are set RadChart will create as many series as the numeric fields in the datasource are.<br/>
