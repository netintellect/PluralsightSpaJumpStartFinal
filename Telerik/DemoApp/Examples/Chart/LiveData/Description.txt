This example demonstrates how RadChart can handle real-life scenarios where running processes monitoring is required. To illustrate this, the chart is refreshed every second with new data. There are two independent YAxes which hold the scales for the CPU utilization in % (left) and the Memory usage in MBs (right). The XAxis labels are rotated to 90 degrees for better readability.
