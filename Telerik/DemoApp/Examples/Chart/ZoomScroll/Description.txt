The example demonstrates the built-in zooming and scrolling features in RadChart. In addition the sampling feature is enabled. Initially, the chart displays data for more than 80 years, sampled to a certain amount of points. When zoomed in, the chart is updated to display the graph for the selected period in more details. To zoom in click and drag within the chart area or drag any of the slider thumbs. You can also use the buttons to zoom in/out or drag the slider to scroll.
