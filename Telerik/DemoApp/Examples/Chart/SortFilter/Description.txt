This example demonstrates the built-in RadChart sorting and filtering functionality. It is much similar to the way it works in RadGridView. To sort and filter the data you need to add Sort and Filter descriptors which are actually derived from their gridview counterparts and share the same API. Use the checkboxes below to filter the data. Select an item from the RadContextMenu to see the sorting mechanism in action.
