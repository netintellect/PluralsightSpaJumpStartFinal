Tic-Tac-Toe is implemented using MVVM. Both the game field and the menu are bound to the same DataSource sharing ItemsSource, Commands and Properties. Undo and Redo collections are updated during the game and changes are reflected by the RadMenu. Clicking in the game boxes at the middle and the RadMenuItems in the Tiles execute the same Commands. The AI Settings menu displays how checkable RadMenuItems can change Boolean properties in the ViewModel using two way bindings.
