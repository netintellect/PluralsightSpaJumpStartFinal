This example demonstrates how to bind Telerik RadMenu to objects that can be either created in code-behind or returned from a web service. To declare the hierarchical Menu structure, you need to create a HierarchicalDataTemplate that specifies the ItemsSource, ItemTemplate and other properties of the item's children. 
To bind RadMenuItem properties, such as IsSeparator, Icon, IsEnabled, etc. we use ContainerBindings. They provide a mechanism for binding the properties of an item container (RadMenuItem, RadTreeViewItem, etc.) to the properties of the data objects. The container bindings are always set through a DataTemplate or HierarchicalDataTemplate.
