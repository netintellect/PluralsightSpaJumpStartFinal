The ColorPicker and ColorSelector controls use PaletteViews to display the colors selection. There are more than 20 pre-defined palettes that provide a wide range of colors from which users can choose. Additionally, both RadColorPicker and RadColorSelector can work with custom palettes.</br>The ColorSelector control is a native part of the RadColorPicker, but it can be used separately as well. Its structure can be controlled through a set of properties - <b>ShowEmptyColor</b>, <b>StandardPaletteVisibility</b>, <b>HeaderPaletteVisibility</b>, etc.
</br>RadColorSelector and RadColorPaletteView are part of the <b>Telerik.Windows.Controls.Input</b> assembly.
