Telerik TreeView fully supports Drag And Drop - to enable the feature you only need to set the <b>IsDragDropEnabled</b> property to true.
TreeView allows custom logic to be executed in order to determine whether the drag or drop operation is supported in particular case.
You can also disable the drop operation onto a node by simply setting the TreeViewItem's <b>IsDropEnabled</b> to false.
