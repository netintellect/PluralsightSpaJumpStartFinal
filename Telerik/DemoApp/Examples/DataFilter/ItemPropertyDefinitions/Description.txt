This example demonstrated the ItemPropertyDefinitions property. When RadDataFilter has its AutoGenerateItemPropertyDefinitions property set to true, it will fill this collection with all item properties read from the Source. Furthermore, you can manually add additional item properties in order to provide access to complex properties for example. In this example, an ItemPropertyDefinition is manually added in XAML. It will filter the squad size based on the Players property Count value.
