When building complex layouts with the Telerik <b>Docking</b> control the users will often expect to persist the layout from one session to another. This can be easily achieved with the advanced <b>Save/Load</b> layout mechansim of the Telerik Docking control. RadDocking provides a method that stores the entire layout in a stream containing XML. Then, you can simply restore the layout from its previous state. In addition, you can choose to save the stream elsewhere, in a textbox as shown in this example, or directly in the isolated storage.
