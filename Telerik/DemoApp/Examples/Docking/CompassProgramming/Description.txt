The <b>Docking</b> control exposes event called <b>PreviewShowCompass</b>. This event is fired just before any of both compasses (the root compass or the inner one) are shown. If cancelled, the compass won't be shown at all. On this event, you also receive a reference to the compass that is to be shown and you can show/hide some of its parts - the left, top, right, bottom and center indicators. In this example is implemented complex logic for hiding showing the indicators and event the whole compasses.
