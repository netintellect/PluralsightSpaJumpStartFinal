With Telerik Calendar control you can select ranges of dates using keys and mouse. In this example, you can use the first calendar to select ranges of dates.
Also, you can prevent other dates from being selected. The second calendar shows pre-defined constraints - ranges of dates that cannot be selected. In the second calendar, the dates in the first and last sub-calendars are disallowed for selection.
