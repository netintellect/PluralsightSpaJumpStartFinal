Custom calculation is a formula that you define yourself to produce values that would not otherwise appear in RadPivotGrid if you used only the source data fields. Custom calculations enable you to extend your data analysis to include results that are specific to your needs. <br/><br/> A calculated field is a new data field in which the values are the result of a custom calculation formula. A calculated field is a custom summary calculation, so it references one or more fields in the source data.
