This sample demonstrates the Load Delay feature of RadDataServiceDataSource. The LoadDelay property is extremely useful when you want to let the end user specify several criteria for data retrieval before sending the request to the server. Each time a certain change occurs (i.e. typing a letter) an AutoLoad timer is re-started. When the timer expires the AutoLoad request is sent to the server. Thanks to this feature there will not be a new server request after each letter entered by the user. RadDataServiceDataSource will "wait" for the specified amount of time before sending the request to the server.
