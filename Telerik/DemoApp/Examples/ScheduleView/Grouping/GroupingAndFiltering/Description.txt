This example demonstrates how you can group RadScheduleView and filter its group headers.

Use the GroupDescriptions collection to specify how RadScheduleView will group its appointments. You have DateGroupDescription that allows you to group by date and ResourceGroupDescription that groups by resource type.

The GroupFilter predicate can be used to specify which group headers will be visible.
