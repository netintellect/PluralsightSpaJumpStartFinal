The GroupHeaderStyleSelector and the GroupHeaderContentTemplateSelector constitute one of the highlights of the RadScheduleView control. Both properties provide greater flexibility that the RadScheduleView manifests. You can use different styles for group headers, or you can simply use Data Templates to control how data is formatted and displayed. Both selectors are Oriented, thus supplying the user with an in-depth control - any template and style can be easily accessed and modified.
