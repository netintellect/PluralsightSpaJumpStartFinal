This example demonstrates how the masked input control can be customized.
	The Bank Account RadMaskedCurrencyInput uses a customized culture to represent its value as a Bank Input form. The modified culture changes the CurrencyGroupSizes and the CurrencyGroupSeparator.
	The Full Name RadMaskedTextInput uses a multiline mask with embedded text to enable first and last name input. It also uses a customized formatting token, which converts the first character of each name section to a capital one.
The three masked input controls also use different kinds of validation - through Data Annotation attributes, intrinsic Validation and custom.
