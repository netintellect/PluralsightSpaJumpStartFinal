RadSparkLines allow empty values to be present in the ItemsSource and you can choose how they should be represented. This example shows the 2009 Formula 1 Driver standings. Each race that the pilot took part is represented by a Win - if he scored, or Loss - if he did not score any point. If the driver did not participate in the race an empty value is added to the ItemsSouce, which is represented as a zero by the sparkline.
