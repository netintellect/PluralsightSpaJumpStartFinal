Telerik Persistence Framework allows you to save the properties of UI elements and restore them back to their previous state.
It provides the ability to select which properties should be included or excluded by the Persistence Framework.</br>The persisted information can be saved in a stream or in the IsolatedStorage. If you use IsolatedStorage the persistence information about each control is saved in a separate file and its name is determined by the PersistenceManager.StorageId attached property.
