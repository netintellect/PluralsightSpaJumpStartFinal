This example demonstrates how to retrieve distinct values from the server. Distinct values are extracted by a custom query because the current version of WCF RIA Services does not support object projections (Select). In your real-life projects, you might want to manually limit the number of distinct values since selecting a very large number of distinct values may cause the generated GET request to exceed the maximum allowed length (2083) and generate an exception.
