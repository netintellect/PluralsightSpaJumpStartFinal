RadMap provides powerful customization options that allow you to change the built-in commands in the MapCommandBar and the zoom levels in the MapZoomBar UI controls with your own.

This example replaces the default CommandBar behavior with custom commands that execute search requests for predefined points of interest through the built-in BingSearchProvider.

Also, the default zoom level presets in the ZoomBar are replaced with three options ("Block", "Neighborhood", and "Downtown") that are more relevant for the visualized map region.
