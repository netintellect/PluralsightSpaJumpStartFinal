Telerik PanelBar control is a versatile component allowing you to build different navigation systems such as left/right side menus and Outlook style panels. The templating mechanism of the control provides the ability to enhance the control’s behavior so that it can successfully represent a complicated site navigation system. This example demonstrates how the PanelBar's items can be customized and how to use the two <b>ExpandModes</b> it supports - <b>Single</b> and <b>Multiple</b>. The built-in <b>Keyboard Support</b> allows you to navigate trough the items using the arrow keys.
