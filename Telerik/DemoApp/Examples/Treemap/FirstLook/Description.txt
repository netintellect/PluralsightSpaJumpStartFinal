The TreeMap control is used to visualize relatively big amount of data in a limited space. The tiles' size represents a measurable quantitative value, while their color might be related to the same or to another value. RadPivotMap expects data in tabular format and displays a treemap with grouped data, according to the GroupDefinitions. 
Use the Layout combobox to change the layout strategy. The Group By combobox will change the way data is presented.
